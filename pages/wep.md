# The Work Experience Program 

The ICI Work Experience Program at Children's Hospital Boston provides paid, temporary work opportunities for individuals with disabilities to experience the world of work. While working in departments throughout the hospital, participants develop personal and vocational skills leading to greater independence. 

The program’s focus is on helping participants develop work skills and behaviors that will enhance their vocational success. Experiencing different job tasks, professional work environments, and different types of relationships at work helps participants to learn what jobs and professional settings are best for them, and to develop realistic career goals. 

Work settings at Children’s Hospital provide opportunities for employment staff to perform assessments and evaluations of individuals’ skills and work habits, in addition to job-targeted education and skills training. 

## Support Services

The Work Experience Program also provides a variety of services designed to support participants. Each participant receives initial job coaching support for transition into the new position, successful learnning and performance of work duties (including development of any tools necessary to do so), and facilitation of natural supports.  Interactions with and feedback from program staff help to promote the participant's ability to make decisions, interact with others, and explore feelings about the future. The program coordinator, in conjunction with the referring counselor, provides case management services for the participant. 

Program staff collaborate with the participant, his/her family, referring agencies and other service providers to develop plans that are consistent wi t eh the participant's interests and needs. Periodic team meetings are scheduled to assist the participant in reviewing his/her experiences in the program. These meetings also provide an opportunity to develop goals and plans for the future.

## Program Outcomes

Program outcomes vary according to individual needs and may include: competitive employment, supported employment, or other employment or educational options.  Referring agents receive assessment and skills-training information on the participant as he/she completes various components of the program. The staff is committed to working closely with the referral agency, participants, and families to create a positive transition and to promote continued vocational and emotional development.


## Eligibility

Applicants must be at least 16 years of age and have a significant disability. The program is designed for individuals who are at the beginning stages of vocational development or who have had difficulty succeeding in other training or work settings. The program is committed to an inclusive model and does not require any previous work skills or experience. Emphasis is placed on the individual's expressed interest and motivation to work and the availability of appropriate supports to ensure a productive work experience. 


## Intake and Referral Process

Individuals may be referred to the program by the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission, Department of Developmental Disabilities, Department of Mental Health, Massachusetts Commission for the Blind, local schools, advocacy groups, family members, or they may refer themselves. Funding is arranged with the referring agency.  Services may also be funded privately. The intake process is designed to assist program staff in understanding the needs of the applicant and to provide the applicant with the information necessary to decide whether he/she wants to participate in the program. 

The admissions process includes three steps. First an informational meeting is scheduled to provide the applicant, family members, referring counselor, and/or other service providers the opportunity to learn more about the program and meet program staff. Next, if the applicant is still interested in the program, an application is completed and formal referral information is requested and reviewed. Finally, a formal interview takes place. Family members are encouraged to participate in all three steps of this process.  After the interview process is completed a decision is made whether or not the applicant will participate in the program. This decision is based on the applicant's interest in participating in the program and on the determination by program staff that there is a good fit between the needs and preferences of the applicant and the program resources available.
