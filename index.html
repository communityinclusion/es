    <h2>The Work Experience Program</h2>
    <p>The ICI Work Experience Program at Children's Hospital Boston provides paid, temporary work opportunities for
      individuals with disabilities to experience the world of work. While working in departments throughout the
      hospital, participants develop personal and vocational skills leading to greater independence. </p>

    <p>The program’s focus is on helping participants develop work skills and behaviors that will enhance their
      vocational success. Experiencing different job tasks, professional work environments, and different types of
      relationships at work helps participants to learn what jobs and professional settings are best for them, and to
      develop realistic career goals. </p>

    <p>Work settings at Children’s Hospital provide opportunities for employment staff to perform assessments and
      evaluations of individuals’ skills and work habits, in addition to job-targeted education and skills training.
    </p>

    <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">

      <h3>Support Services</h3>

      <p>The Work Experience Program also provides a variety of services designed to support participants. Each
        participant receives initial job coaching support for transition into the new position, successful learnning and
        performance of work duties (including development of any tools necessary to do so), and facilitation of natural
        supports. Interactions with and feedback from program staff help to promote the participant's ability to make
        decisions, interact with others, and explore feelings about the future. The program coordinator, in conjunction
        with the referring counselor, provides case management services for the participant. </p>

      <p>Program staff collaborate with the participant, his/her family, referring agencies and other service providers
        to develop plans that are consistent wi t eh the participant's interests and needs. Periodic team meetings are
        scheduled to assist the participant in reviewing his/her experiences in the program. These meetings also provide
        an opportunity to develop goals and plans for the future.</p>

      <h3>Program Outcomes</h3>

      <p>Program outcomes vary according to individual needs and may include: competitive employment, supported
        employment, or other employment or educational options. Referring agents receive assessment and skills-training
        information on the participant as he/she completes various components of the program. The staff is committed to
        working closely with the referral agency, participants, and families to create a positive transition and to
        promote continued vocational and emotional development.</p>


      <h3>Eligibility</h3>

      <p>Applicants must be at least 16 years of age and have a significant disability. The program is designed for
        individuals who are at the beginning stages of vocational development or who have had difficulty succeeding in
        other training or work settings. The program is committed to an inclusive model and does not require any
        previous work skills or experience. Emphasis is placed on the individual's expressed interest and motivation to
        work and the availability of appropriate supports to ensure a productive work experience. </p>


      <h3>Intake and Referral Process</h3>

      <p>Individuals may be referred to the program by the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission, Department of
        Developmental Disabilities, Department of Mental Health, Massachusetts Commission for the Blind, local schools,
        advocacy groups, family members, or they may refer themselves. Funding is arranged with the referring agency.
        Services may also be funded privately. The intake process is designed to assist program staff in understanding
        the needs of the applicant and to provide the applicant with the information necessary to decide whether he/she
        wants to participate in the program. </p>

      <p>The admissions process includes three steps. First an informational meeting is scheduled to provide the
        applicant, family members, referring counselor, and/or other service providers the opportunity to learn more
        about the program and meet program staff. Next, if the applicant is still interested in the program, an
        application is completed and formal referral information is requested and reviewed. Finally, a formal interview
        takes place. Family members are encouraged to participate in all three steps of this process. After the
        interview process is completed a decision is made whether or not the applicant will participate in the program.
        This decision is based on the applicant's interest in participating in the program and on the determination by
        program staff that there is a good fit between the needs and preferences of the applicant and the program
        resources available. </p>

    <h2>Individual Placement Service</h2>

    <p>Since 1987, the Individual Placement Service (IPS) of the Institute for Community Inclusion has been providing
      individualized supports to people with disabilities seeking employment. </p>


    <h3>Services include:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Person-centered career planning</li>
      <li>Individualized job development services</li>
      <li>Resume development and job seeking skills training</li>
      <li>Individualized support and training to facilitate success at a job</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        Read more about the Individual Placement Service
      </a>

    </p>
    <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample2">
      <p>The IPS assists individuals with disabilities in seeking, securing and maintaining paid employment. These
        services are highly individualized, providing a wide range of supports for individuals with varied interests,
        skills, and needs. For individuals seeking employment, person-centered career planning remains a cornerstone of
        the service. Through the career planning process individuals articulate their goals and expectations for
        employment. The career plan guides the job development process, identifying the type of work, the culture of the
        work environment, as well as other preferences identified by the job seeker, such as pay, benefits, location,
        and work schedule. In addition to job placement, services may include job seeking skills training, resume
        development, case coordination, assistance with benefits, job coaching, travel training, and other work-related
        supports. </p>

      <p>All placements occur in community-based employment settings. Individuals become employees of the company where
        they work. Each employer, according to existing personnel practices, determines work schedules, wages, and
        benefits. </p>

      <p>Once an individual gets a job, supports are provided to facilitate the individual’s successful transition into
        employment. The IPS serves individuals with varied support needs. Upon placement, a plan will be developed with
        each individual to identify the amount and type of support needed to promote successful employment. The IPS
        works with each participant and their employer to facilitate the acquisition of skills needed to maintain the
        job and to facilitate the development of natural supports. While some participants need long-term supports, for
        many individuals services fade over time. </p>

      <p>The IPS also provides services to individuals who may be working but need additional support to be successful
        at work. The IPS will work with each individual, employer, and referral agency to develop an individual plan for
        employment supports.</p>


      <h3>Eligibility and Referral Process:</h3>

      <p>To be eligible for the IPS an applicant must be 16 years of age or older and demonstrate motivation to work.
        The intake process for the program is designed to assist program staff in understanding the needs of the
        applicant and to provide the applicant with the information necessary to decide if he/she wants to participate
        in the program. Potential applicants first attend an informational interview to get more information about the
        services offered. If interested in the IPS, the individual will be asked to complete an application and schedule
        an interview. Family members and other service providers are welcomed and encouraged to participate in the
        interview process. The purpose of the referral process is to ensure that the individual makes an informed
        decision to participate in the IPS and that the services offered are consistent with the individual's goals and
        support needs. </p>

      <p>Referrals can be made by the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission, the departments of Mental Health and
        Developmental Disabilities, Massachusetts Commission for the Blind, local educational associations, advocacy
        groups, families, or potential participants. Funding is arranged on an individual basis with the referring
        agency. Services may also be funded privately. </p>
